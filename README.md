Textbased Game 

TextBound is a minimalist text-based adventure game written in C++.
You start in a village square and can explore up to 4 different locations including a shop, forest, home, and tavern.
You can pick up and drop items, move between locations, and interact with the environment via simple text commands.

This project is a basic demonstration of:

- C++ input/output with cin and cout
- Using vectors to manage inventory and items
- Simple game state management with strings and booleans
- Command parsing and control flow

Features
Move between locations using commands such as "move north," "move east," etc.

- Pick up items using get item_name
- Drop items using drop item_name
- See descriptions of locations and available items
- Simple inventory management with item tracking
